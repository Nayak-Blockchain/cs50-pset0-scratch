# CS50 Problem Set 0: Blockchain Token Chase

A Scratch project for CS50 Week 0, where a wallet sprite chases a token sprite in an Arctic-themed environment.

## Description
This project is a simple game built in Scratch for CS50's Problem Set 0. A wallet sprite (a cat) chases a token sprite (a diamond) in an Arctic environment. The player uses arrow keys to move the wallet. When the wallet touches the token, the token says "Received!" for 2 seconds, plays a "Collect" sound, increases the score by 1, hides for 1 second, and then reappears in a random position.

## Features
- **Two Sprites:** Wallet (cat) and Token (diamond).
- **Movement:** Wallet moves with arrow keys; token moves to random positions every 2 seconds.
- **Interaction:** When the wallet touches the token, it triggers a message, sound, score update, and token respawn.
- **Score Counter:** Tracks how many tokens the wallet collects.
- **Background:** Arctic theme for a visually appealing setting.
